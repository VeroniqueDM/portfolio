                {/* Greetings! I'm Veronika Miteva, a full-stack web developer. A
                few years back, driven by curiosity, I came across a video
                tutorial that guided me through writing my first "Hello
                World!" program. Since that moment, I've dedicated my spare time
                to mastering the art of coding. While my primary passion lies in
                back-end development, I've also acquired substantial knowledge
                and experience in front-end development. */}
                Greetings! I'm Veronika Miteva, a proficient full-stack web
                developer. My journey into the realm of coding began a few years
                ago, sparked by a simple yet crucial moment of curiosity. I
                vividly remember following a video tutorial that led me to craft
                my very first "Hello World!" program. That experience ignited a
                deep-seated passion for programming, which has since become a
                significant part of my life. Over the past 2 years, I have
                diligently devoted my time to enhancing my coding skills. While
                my primary enthusiasm and expertise lie in back-end development,
                I have simultaneously expanded my capabilities to include a
                considerable proficiency in front-end development. This dual
                focus allows me to approach web development with a comprehensive
                understanding and a unique perspective. I am excited about the
                opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional
                setting, continuing to grow and contribute to impactful web
                development projects.
