            <p>
                Greetings! I'm Veronika Miteva, a full-stack web developer. A
                few years back, driven by curiosity, I came across a video
                tutorial that guided me through writing my first "Hello
                World!" program. Since that moment, I've dedicated my spare time
                to mastering the art of coding. While my primary passion lies in
                back-end development, I've also acquired substantial knowledge
                and experience in front-end development.
            </p>
